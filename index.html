<h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>
The World Wide Web, also known
as the WWW and the Web, is an information space
where documents and other
web resources are identified by
Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible
via the Internet.
English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the
World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser
in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.
The browser was released outside CERN in 1991,
first to other research institutions starting in
January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet
in August 1991. </p>
