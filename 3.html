<h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>
  JavaScript often abbreviated as JS,
  is a high-level, interpreted programming language
   that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
   It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic,
   weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is
one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.
 JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential
 part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,
  and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine
  to execute it.
